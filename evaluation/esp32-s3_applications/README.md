# ESP32-S3 evaluation results

Results of the full pipeline (`trace.py`, `mine.py`, `precision_recall.py`) on the
ESP32-S3-Zero, in the layout of `evaluation/stm32_applications/`:

```text
esp32-s3_<target>/trial-<n>-<setup>/
├── seed.N.in.trace      # one trace per seed
├── method_trees.json, loop_trees.json, mined_g.json, parsing_g.json

├── out.log
└── run/                 # provenance: configuration, build, flash and stage logs, times.txt
```

`<target>` is `cgidecode`, `arduinojson` or `libyxml`. `<setup>` is `1-watchpoint` or
`2-watchpoints` (hardware watchpoints used while tracing; `watchpoint_count` of the configuration).

## evaluation.json

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `precision`, `recall`, `f1` | ratio, 0 to 1 | Written by `src/eval/precision_recall.py`. |
| `no_tested_inputs` | requests | Inputs the miner sent to the board. Equals `mining.requests.total`. |
| `watchpoint_count` | count | Hardware watchpoints used (`watchpoint_count` of the run's configuration). |
| `execution_duration` | seconds | `tracing.duration` + `mining.duration`. |
| `tracing.duration` | seconds | Sum of `tracing.seeds`. Start-up and a seed lost to a stop are not counted. |
| `tracing.seeds` | seconds | One `{seed, duration}` entry per written trace, sorted by seed number. |
| `mining.duration` | seconds | The miner's own timer (`Mining time` in `run/mine.log`). |
| `mining.requests` | requests | Board requests per step: `methods`, `loops`, `tokens` and their `total`. |
| `mining.throughput` | requests per second | `mining.requests.total` / `mining.duration`. |
| `evaluation_duration` | seconds | Wall time of `precision_recall.py`, which has no timer of its own. |

The statistics are derived from the logs in `run/`:

- A seed's duration is the time between `Start generating trace for` and `Write trace of` in
  `trace.log`. A seed that was interrupted and traced again counts once, for the run that wrote its
  trace. The logs of the resumed `trace.py` calls are not published; the `trace-resume-N` rows of
  `times.txt` list the seeds each resume traced (`seeds=`).
- `mining.requests` adds up the `Used N requests to generalize` lines of `mine.log`.
- `evaluation_duration` is the sum of the `eval` rows of `times.txt`.

## Comparison with the Linux results

`execution_duration` in `evaluation/linux_applications/` is the wall time of `trace.py` plus
`mine.py` (`run_experiment.sh`). Here it is real time: the start-up of the tools and the seed in
progress when `trace.py` stopped are not counted. The wall time of every stage is in
`run/times.txt`.
